      <span>Throwing candy out to the crowd</span>

      <span>Dragging down the main</span>
      <br />
      <span>The helpless little thing with the dirty mouth</span>
      <br />
      <span>Who's always got something to say</span>
      <br />
      <span>You're sitting around at home now</span>
      <br />
      <span>Waiting for your brother to call</span>
      <br />
      <span>I saw him down in the alley</span>
      <br />
      <span>Having had enough of it all</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>Said you can do what you want to whenever you want to</span>
      <br />
      <span>You can do what you want to there's no one to stop you</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>All spit and spite you're up all night and down every day</span>
      <br />
      <span>A tired man with only hours to go just waiting to be taken away</span>
      <br />
      <span>Getting into the back of a car for candy from some stranger</span>
      <br />
      <span>Watching the parade with pinpoint eyes full of smoldering anger</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>You can do what you want to whenever you want to</span>
      <br />
      <span>You can do what you want to there's no one to stop you</span>
      <br />
      <span>Now you can do what you want to whenever you want to</span>
      <br />
      <span>Do what you want to whenever you want to</span>
      <br />
      <span>Do what you want to whenever you want to</span>
      <br />
      <span>Though it doesn't mean a thing</span>
      <br />
      <span>Big nothing</span>
