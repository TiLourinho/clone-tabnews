      <h1>Ballad of Big Nothing</h1>
      <p>
        Throwing candy out to the crowd
        <br />
        Dragging down the main
        <br />
        The helpless little thing with the dirty mouth
        <br />
        Who's always got something to say
        <br />
        You're sitting around at home now
        <br />
        Waiting for your brother to call
        <br />
        I saw him down in the alley
        <br />
        Having had enough of it all
      </p>
      <p>
        Said you can do what you want to whenever you want to
        <br />
        You can do what you want to there's no one to stop you
      </p>
      <p>
        All spit and spite you're up all night
        <br />
        And down every day
        <br />
        A tired man with only hours to go
        <br />
        Just waiting to be taken away
        <br />
        Getting into the back of a car for
        <br />
        Candy from some stranger
        <br />
        Watching the parade with pinpoint eyes
        <br />
        Full of smoldering anger
      </p>
      <p>
        You can do what you want to whenever you want to
        <br />
        You can do what you want to there's no one to stop you
        <br />
        Now you can do what you want to whenever you want to
        <br />
        Do what you want to whenever you want to
        <br />
        Do what you want to whenever you want to
        <br />
        Though it doesn't mean a thing
        <br />
        Big nothing
      </p>
    </main>
